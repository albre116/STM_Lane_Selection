# STM_Lane_Selection
Structural Topic Modeling for Customer &amp; Carrier Lane Segmentation

The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of using a Structural Topic Model (STM) for classifying carrier or customer selection based upon the bundle of loads each comprises.  Specifically, our use of this framework implies that:
- Corridor (i.e. Topics) -> Mixture of load origins and destinations (i.e. words)
- Carrier (i.e. Document) -> Mixture over Cooridors (i.e. Topics)

This could be useful because it may allow us to select appropriate Carrier based upon a customer origin/load profile sheet.
